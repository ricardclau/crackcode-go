Linked Lists
------------

- Delete duplicates in a Single Linked List with no extra structures: deletedupes.go
- Implement an algorithm to find the nth to the last element of a singly linked list: nthtothelast.go
- Delete a node from a Linked List with only access to that node: deletenode.go
	* If node to be deleted happens to be the last in the LinkedList the problem is impossible to solve

Queues
------

- Stack using a Linked List: stacklinkedlist.go
- Queue using a Linked List: queuelinkedlist.go
- Stack using a resizing array: stackresizingarray.go
- Queue using a resizing array: queueresizingarray.go
